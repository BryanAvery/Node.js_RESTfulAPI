# RESTful API

This is an app demonstrating simple API implementation with Node.js, Express and MongoDb

The `api` uri preceeds all API endpoints and the following endpoints are currently available

* GET `/api/contacts`
* POST `/api/contacts`
* GET `/api/contacts/:id`
* PUT `/api/contacts/:id`
* PATCH `/api/contacts/:id`
* DELETE `/api/contacts/:id`

The live UI driven app version is available on heroku here, which is using these RESTful API endpoints
