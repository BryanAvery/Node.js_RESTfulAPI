The companion tutorial on building can be found here <b>How To Build Simple RESTful API With Node.js, Express.js AndÂ MongoDb</b> 

The `api` uri preceeds all API endpoints and the following endpoints are currently available
* GET `/api/contacts`
* POST `/api/contacts`
* GET `/api/contacts/:id`
* PUT `/api/contacts/:id`
* PATCH `/api/contacts/:id`
* DELETE `/api/contacts/:id`

The live UI driven app version is available on heroku here, which is using these RESTful API endpoints
